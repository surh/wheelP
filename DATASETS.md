# Datasets in wheelP

A number of Data objects are provided. These correspond to the experimental data that was analyzed,
and underlying numeric values for several figures in the associated manuscript.
Raw sequence data can be found in the appropriate repositories ([GSE102248](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102248), [PRJEB22060](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB22060)).
