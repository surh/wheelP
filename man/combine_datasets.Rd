\title{Combine datasets}
\usage{
combine_datasets(datasets)
}
\arguments{
\item{datasets}{either a single Dataset object or a list
of dataset objects}
}
\description{
Combine a list of Datasates.
}
\details{
All datasets must have the same variables in the same order
in their Map attribute. Redundant samples (ie samples in more
one dataset), have their counts added.
Taxa neeed not be the same in all datasets. The union of taxa
will be used as long as all the intersections are identical
in the Tax elements. Taxa missing from a specific dataset
will be added with count zero for the samples in that dataset.

There might be some issues when map is not null and there are
redundant samples
