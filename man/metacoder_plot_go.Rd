\title{Plot GO from edgeR}
\usage{
metacoder_plot_go(dat, output_folder = "./", output_format = "svg",
  min_fdr = 0.01, type = GO.db::GOBPPARENTS, prefix = "go",
  n.supertaxa = 9, num.changed = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame containing the results of differential expression analysis on
edgeR. The data frame is the result of performing hypothesis testing, for example
with the likelihood ratio test (i.e. function \code{\link{glmLRT}}).}

\item{output_folder}{Charachter string indicating the directory to store the
plots.}

\item{output_format}{Format of the image to save. It must be allowed
by the \code{\link{heat_tree}} function.}

\item{min_fdr}{False discovery rate threshold to filter genes. Only genes
with a smaller fdr and their annotations will be included.}

\item{type}{This must be an object that specifies the parents of each
annotation terms. Default is object GOBPPARENTS fromthe GO.db bioconductor
package, but any other simular object can be used.}

\item{prefix}{Character string. Prefix for file names.}

\item{n.supertaxa}{Number of levels to extend the tree.}

\item{num.changed}{Minimum number of genes in an annotation category
fir that annotation to be included.}
}
\description{
Creates a metacoder network plot from gene ontologies. Figures from this function
where not included in final manuscript.
}
\details{
The script takes a list of differentially expressed genes and their GO annotations
and creates a tree representing the gene ontologies present and color codes it by
the overal log(fold-change) im expression/
